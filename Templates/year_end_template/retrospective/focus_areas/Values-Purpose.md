# Values and Purpose

The goal of this section is to think about your values & purpose in life. This somewhat relates to 'impact' but is more about thinking about
what's important to you. Is it "making sure my family is provided for"? Is it "making sure my work aligns with my ethical or religious values"? Is it
making sure you're a good (person/member-of-a-religion/member-of-a-profession/etc.)?

What rules should you keep in mind when making decisions? Do you feel like you kept to them in the last year? Are there times where you feel like you
didn't--where you weren't necessarily the person you want to be? What could you do to change that? Etc.
