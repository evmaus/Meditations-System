# Impact and Contribution

Many folks want to make a difference in the world in some way or another. This is about thinking about the things you have done--at work,
at home, in your community, etc. that may have had an impact on the world. Some of that may be charitable giving, volunteering, caring for
friends or loved ones, leadership in a church group, etc. Some of that may be making something faster or better or more energy efficient in your
field of work. Either way--this area is a space to think about that and to check in if you're happy about how things are going there.
