# Health and Fitness

We are, at least for now, stuck in our bodies. This section is about physical health & fitness. I personally tend to
focus on abilities/things rather than weight or body shape (e.x. I find "I'd like to deadlift 200lbs" or "I'd like to do 10 pull ups",
way better than "I'd like to lose 20 lbs" for me). However, you can use whatever model you want here.

Do think about things like--is your blood pressure OK? Do you generally feel good when you wake up in the morning? How are you sleeping?
etc. as well as just the things our society says are "health" (really just 'weight', which is dumb). This section is just about checking in to make sure
you feel like you're doing a good job taking care of yourself, in whatever way that means to you. We're all just weird bacon-jellyfish-things piloting
meat-and-bone mini-mechwarriors, so this is about making sure your own personal meat-Gundam has its regular oil changes.
