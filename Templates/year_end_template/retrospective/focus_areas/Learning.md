# Learning

This is more important to some than others, but I've always tried to keep learning (in structured or unstructured ways) every year of my life,
especially post-college. This is an area to reflect on what you may have learned in the last year.

## Summary/Current Status

## What went well?

## What went poorly?

## Where did I try hard?

## Where did I not try enough?

## What is the most important problem here?

## What is my biggest bottleneck?

## What is most holding me back from achieving my full potential?

## What single thing, if successfully performed, would have the biggest impact here?
