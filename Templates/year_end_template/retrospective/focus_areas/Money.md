# Money and Finances

Look, most of us are stuck in a capitalist system, and money is kind of the lifeblood of that. This is an area to think about your finances:
are you where you want to be in the general "earning" area? Is there a sum of money over your current income that would dramatically increase
your happiness? Alternatively, do you feel like you may be trading too much of your time or life for money (e.x. missing your family or etc.)?

There are obviously no "right answers" to any of these--this is all intensely personal. But it's worth looking over things like your current assets/debts
and such, and potentially making a budget/etc. at least once a year (so this is a good time to do it!).

## What is the most important problem here?

## What is my biggest bottleneck?

## What is most holding me back from achieving my full potential?

## What single thing, if successfully performed, would have the biggest impact here?
