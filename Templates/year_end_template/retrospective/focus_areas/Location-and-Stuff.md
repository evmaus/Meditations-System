# Location and Tangibles

This is about things like "Where you live" and "the stuff that you have". There's tons of writing and books on the relationship people have with their
stuff. This is just an area to think about--do you like where you live, both in the macro level (city/country) and the micro level (apartment,
neighborhood, etc.). It's also an area to think about--do you have too much stuff? Is your stuff making you happy or miserable? Are there physical things
(organizational systems, a dishwasher, or a new mattress) that you could get that would improve your life? Take time to note what they are here.
