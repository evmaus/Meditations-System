# Social Life

This is about evaluating your "social life"--the extended group of people you consider friends or friendly acquintances & socialize with regularly. Are you
happy with that group?  Are there things you want to do more around with them? Are there any that are unhealthy, or which you may need to renegotiate or
set different boundaries with? Are there any of these connections that you'd like to deepen in the next year or two? And so on.
