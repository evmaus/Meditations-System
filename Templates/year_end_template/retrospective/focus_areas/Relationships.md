# Relationships

This is about the relationships with those closest to you--your family, your lovers, etc. Do you feel they're generally going well? Are there things you
want to do more around with them? Are there any that are unhealthy, or which you may need to renegotiate or set different boundaries with? Are there any of
these connections that you'd like to deepen in the next year or two? Are there goals you have around ways you'd like to show these people that you care
about them? Do the people in this know how important they are to you?

This honestly can be combined with 'Social', as well, depending on how you draw lines around family vs. friends vs. acquaintances. My take is that our
society draws some arbitrary and not always 'real' lines around these things. Don't worry too much about it, or combine them if that's easier.
