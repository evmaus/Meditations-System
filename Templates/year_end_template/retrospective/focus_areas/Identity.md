# Character and Identity

This is about how you feel about yourself--who you are, what you like, how much you feel "yourself" in your life. Many parts of modern
society ask/require us to hide parts of yourself to function or take part in (e.x. the metaphorical "closet" for queer folk). Similarly,
many of us are told who or what we should be by our friends, our parents, our religions, our society, etc. This is about thinking about who
you are, how those things are currently affecting you, and where you feel that's good or bad.
