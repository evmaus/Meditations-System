# General Overview - (Year)

This area is just a holistic/general view of the full year. I tend to fill this out after the focus areas, to try to capture anything that didn't make it
into a focus area or to synthesize all of the things that wound up in the focus area.

## Summary/Current Status

## What Went Well?

## What went poorly?

## What would you like to change from the past year?

## What would you like to sustain from the past year?

## Any other thoughts about the past year?
