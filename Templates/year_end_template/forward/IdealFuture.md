# Ideal Future

The purpose of this is to just daydream about what your 'ideal future self' looks like. Do you want to be famous? Build a family? Be well known in a small
group, or a major contributor to a community you're part of? Put that here. The point is to get all those desires out in text so that you can think about
them and how your goals may relate to them.

* (List some thinking about where you'd like to be in 3-5 years here; just use bullet points or w/e unless you really want to use prose.)
