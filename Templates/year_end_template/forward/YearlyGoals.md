# YEAR HEADING

## Theme

This section is about a "theme" for the year. Is this the year of "Improving your health"? Or "Growing your leadership skills"? Or maybe it's the year of
recovering from a global pandemic? This exists mostly to help tie the things in "Big Goals" to your "Ideal Future Self".

## Big Goals

Take the yearly focus areas, and rank them on whatever scale feels appropriate (1-5, 1-10, etc.) on "How well, generally, do I feel this area is going?"

Don't think too hard about that--the point is really just to help prioritize the areas that you feel are important but where you also feel you're doing
the worst.

Then copy the "most important" task or goal from the focus areas (or add new ones), and workshop that into some larger goals. Try to have only one or two per area, unless you're only going to focus on a single area for the entire year.

## Highest Priority

- Here, you should sort goals from each area by how important/likely to improve your life they are.

## Milestones

If you're doing the monthly or quarterly review, consider putting a measurable level of what success will look like for each of the goals at particular
months. For example, if you intend to work out twice a week, you would have roughly 8 workouts completed by the end of January. If you have a conference
Call For Papers that you want to submit to in early May, you'd potentially want to have the rough draft done by late March or early April. If you want to
devote a month to improving your artwork or studying some topic, pick a month that seems promising! And so on.
