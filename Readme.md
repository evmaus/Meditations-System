# A Lightweight System for Meditations on Life

## Purpose

This is a set of templates I've slowly put together over a number of years that I've found helpful when thinking about
how my life is going and if there are things I want to fix or change about it. I'll admit I drew on a TON of sources
when I was thinking about how to put these together from 2013 to 2020: to the point where I'm honestly not sure which ideas came from which
location at this point. I'll try to put some of the influences that I can identify in these down in the "Influences" section.

At this point, I'd say that although this has been inspired by many things, at this point it's definitely a unique construction all its own.

Although the actual contents of these 'Meditations' tend to be very personal for me, after some conversations I realized that
the templates I use might be helpful for other folks.

## Guide

There are a few ways to use the templates in this, and I've found all of them helpful.

1. The "Light Weight" Year-End Review: For this, you just are committing to a single, end of year review of your life and goals.
   If you can only do one thing, I recommend this--I've found it incredibly useful to just take a moment to step back sometimes and
   make sure you're happy with how you've been moving through life.
2. The "Monthly or Quarterly" Review: For this, you do the year end review, and then block out goals & milestones over the course of the year.
   For example, you mark important dates (conferences, product releases, Comicons, etc.). Then you evaluate your progress against those (and remain
   flexible--maybe something like a global pandemic came up and you won't be cosplaying at a Comicon!). Then you set aside an hour or two every month or every quarter (or both) to do a "mini-retrospective" where you just think about how you're doing against what you evaluated at the start of the year.
3. The "Week-by-Week" Review: This is the most labor intensive version, but I've found it very helpful for course-correcting quickly if I start to move
   away from some goal of mine. This is the "Monthly/Quarterly Review", but you add in taking 30-45 minutes every week to look back at the last week and towards the next week.

Each of these have pros and cons. I've found that the weekly is very useful for me sometimes, but tends to be quick to fall apart under stress, and if
you're liable to feel guilty if you abandon any part of a "system", it can be counterproductive. However, I found the weekly coupled with daily index cards
(writing down regular index cards with daily goals) was very good at keeping me organized on very fast paced or more intense times of my life (e.x. taking
multiple graduate math classes at the same time).

## On Goals

There's tons of literature on goals. I've found that the whole "SMART" goal idea makes sense, but the biggest thing for me is making them somewhat
objective and measurable--"I will read (# of books) in the next year" is measurable, "read more" is not.

There's tons of research in this area around who you should/shouldn't share your goals with, what accountability systems work, etc.--and sometimes the
advice is honestly at odds (committing to a goal makes you more likely to achieve it, but sharing the goal with friends may make you less likely to, but...
etc.). My take is that there's probably little kernels of truth in any of them, so just try some things out and find out what works for you.

I've found having someone who can hold me accountable (a partner, especially if they share a similar goal, or a coach/mentor who can check in with me) is
useful, but sharing my goals far and wide is not. But, your mileage there may vary--play around with this stuff.

I would also say--apparently it takes about a month or two to build a habit. I've often fell into the trap of trying to change "everything" at once. This
tends to work for even up to a month for me, and then something will shift and it stops working well. The point of prioritizing the goals in the year-end
review process is to spread them out, ideally using the monthly process, so that you can build new habits over time instead of trying to have a bunch of
new commitments right after the new year (since that sets me up for failure, I've found).

## Year-End-Review Process

I'd say this is what I'm most consistently good at doing. The general idea is that you break down your life into a number of areas,
and then think about each independently, first looking backwards and then using that to drive how you approach the next year.

The process itself is fairly simple:

0. Make a copy of the "year_end_template" code to a new location, and rename it something more useful like "was-2020-any-good" or "2020-year-end-review".
1. Start by identifying "Focus Areas" for your life. These are up to you--I have the ones I like in the "retrospective/focus_areas"
   folder, but you should pick your own if they don't resonate--mine have changed every few years. Have a focus area file for each
   area you're evaluating.
2. Fill out, to whatever degree you want to, the questions in the "Focus Area" files. These are for you, if a particular question doesn't
   resonate for an area, just throw it out and delete it, put N/A or leave it blank. If a particular question never resonates, delete it everywhere
   and don't use it in the future! My set of these questions tends to shift year over year (so this is just currently the 2018-2020 version).
3. Afterwards, take some time to read back over those, and then fill out the questions in the more "General" review. The goal of that is to provide a bit
   of a "holistic" view of your whole life that might not be captured if you just look at single areas. You could have missed an area, or there might be something that crosses several areas that you weren't really able to fit but feel is important. Stick that stuff there.
4. After you've done the "year end retrospective" where you're looking back, it's time to look forward--first, fill out the "IdealFuture.md". The idea of
   that file is just to give an area for you to think generally about where you'd like to be in a year, or three years, or ten years--it's for daydreaming about what a successful life would look like to you.
5. Take the areas you evaluated in focus areas, and copy the 'title' into the "Yearly Goals" area. Where you have them, also put the
   "action you could take that would make the most difference" in a bulleted form underneath it. You have a choice here--you can then either rank how you
   feel each area is doing (on a 1-5 or 1-10 scale), and then pick a theme for the year and describe it, or you can pick a theme and then rank the areas. Either works, although I tend to pick the theme second to the evaluation--to me, the theme exists to give me a narrative about how the individual goals ("work out twice a week") maps to where I want to be in the "Ideal Future" area.
6. You're more or less done! The next thing to do is to just take the areas of your life you feel need to be most improved, and copy those goals into the
   "Highest Priority" section. If you don't intend to do monthly/quarterly check-ins, at this point you're done. Try to work on one or two goals (esp. those that require building a habit) at a time over the course of the year & check in at whatever rate makes sense for you. Go through the long process at the end of the next year to see what worked and what didn't!

If you're doing the monthly/quarterly process, continue to the next section.

## Monthly/Quarterly Process

For the monthly/quarterly process, there's even more options/flexibility, depending on how structured & likely to change your life is. In general,
the main choice is between "up front planning" or "periodic planning".

I've found a hybrid approach helpful--I'll do up front planning for things that are likely to be big or stressful, that I know are coming up. For instance,
if you know you have a conference presentation, stressful month at work, or publication deadline coming up, you should put it in that into the appropriate
month at the start of the year or quarter. Similarly, if your goals for the year are things like "work out 2x a week" or "spend a month learning
about philosophy", picking a month or noting how many work outs you want to have achieved by the end of the first 3 months at the start of the year is a
good move.

The monthly/quarterly process are basically the same (and are compatible!) and basically boils down to:

1. At the start of the month or quarter, look back at the last month/quarter (except at the start of the year, since you sort of are doing that in the
   year-end retrospective). Fill out the "Retrospective" piece for the prior month/quarter--did you achieve your goals? If not, why not? What could you change to make sure you achieve them in the future (if they are still reasonable to do so)?
2. Then look forward--if you set aside some part of the year for a goal (e.x. "In March, I will boost my creativity by painting twice a week"), then figure
   out if that's still reasonable. (If it isn't, no sweat--push it to a future month where it's more likely to be!). Otherwise, add it to your monthly list of things to do/goals/etc. Then put any obligations you have into the things you need to do that month as well (work, personal... doesn't really matter which you use in my opinion).
3. If you're coupling this with the weekly process, it can help to plan particular weeks of the month or quarter for particular tasks (e.x. Week 2, I will
   get the materials for the new cabinets in my kitchen. Week 3 and 4, I will be building the new cabinets.)

Then you just repeat this process. I've found that I can usually do a monthly review in an hour, and a quarterly review in a hour if I'm also doing
monthly reviews (and more like a 2-3 hour process if I'm not).

Obviously you can break this up however works for you--if you're in school or at university, semesters + summer might make more sense than yearly quarters.
The point of this is not to be dogmatic, it's to figure out which parts are useful for you and then use those as appropriate.

## Week-By-Week Process

This is basically just the same as the monthly process, but you do it week to week. I've found this is very useful for helping you get a sense of what you
can and can't do in a week (I often overestimate what can be done in a week or month and underestimate 3-6 month+ timeframes, personally!).

I've found I can do a weekly review in 30-45 minutes when I'm in the swing of it (but if I'm restarting after a while not doing it it can take more like an
hour to an hour and a half).

You can couple the week-by-week process with time blocking, index cards, etc.--whatever works for you for organizing your day to day life. I tend to use
my calendar for reminders & meetings & timed obligations, and then work around that at the moment (but I've done other things in the past, esp. if I felt
like I wasn't getting enough time to work on certain things).

## Influences

Cal Newport's books on [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) and
[Studying in College](https://www.calnewport.com/books/straight-a-student/) were influential in the very initial version of this that I put together in
late college. However, I found the time blocking approach of making sure every minute was accounted for became less useful for me after college--so the
weekly templates were simplified dramatically.

I'm reasonably certain the current weekly/monthly/quarterly templates were basically my attempt at making the "lightest weight possible"
version of Cal Newport's system while still keeping the main idea of "it's good to think about what you want to accomplish and then
check to see if you did". I have tended to find a lot of success with combining them with a daily "Index-card-based-productivity" system, which I'm able
to find way too many versions of online. (As someone with ADHD, I tend to reject heavy-weight systems; my goal has been to make this useful without feeling
onerous).

Some of the other ideas (focus areas, etc.) were also cribbed from elsewhere (but I'm not sure where, as I've been unable to identify the original source
since I immediately changed the way that life was broken down.

## Some Notes

I originally called the private (and not on github) copy of the git repository I use to store these "Meditations", in the classic sense of "a space to
jot down some thoughts about life". So I figured I'd keep that.

These files are largely in Markdown. I recommend using Visual Studio Code or similar to edit them. Markdown is nice because if you want to create a
pretty-printed version of everything, you can.

## Contributing/Reuse

Honestly, this is just a personal set of markdown files in case others find them useful. Fork it, use it, etc. Feel free to let me know if you found it
